This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Configuration

This application needs to use an API end point which can be configured by creating a `.env.local` file (this file is ignored in `.gitignore`). If you are running the API instance locally, then the content of this file will be as following:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
```
Make sure you have cors enabled on the API end point as by default this application runs on port 3000.

## Running


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/dashboard/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
